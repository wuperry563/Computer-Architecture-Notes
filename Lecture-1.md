### CPU
RISC vs CISC
North Bridge and South Bridges

### Metrics
What are some of the metrics of something that works?

### Memory
DRAM
SRAM


###First Computer
The Babbage difference machine (1832)
ENIAC 1945
    - Built out of vacuum tubes, faster than the babbage difference machine
    - Multiplied two 10 bit numbers at 300/second
    - Spurred the question of how to make them faster.

###Von Neumann 
1903-1957
Before Neumann, computer were specialized-designed
This new Von Neumann architecture allowed software to be run on hardware.

### Transistors
Enabled the transistor products and smaller computers
Led to creation of Integrated Circuit
    -Jack Kilby/ Robert Noyce, filed a patent for IC.
        -More transistors on a single piece of silicon(die)
-Intel was founded by Robert Noyce
    -First memory chip 1kb
    -Make memory afforadable
    
### IBM Mainstream PC
Source an CPU from Intel,
Digital Research developed the OS.
IBM Contact Microsoft for the first BASIC compiler
Cant patent
IBM Wrote the BIOS, in addition to putting CPU memory/Compiler together
Phoenix Software developed a legal way around the reverse engineering
-Look at the code, write the specs
-second team write sthe code in specs
-Then Sell the bios.
